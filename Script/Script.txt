A woman got out of a taxi on a quiet street and went home. 
She opened the gate and door, put her bag and phone down, 
and washed her face and hands. Then, she went upstairs to 
her bedroom. As she was going to bed, the lights went out.

She found a candle and lit it. Suddenly, she heard strange 
sounds like people walking around on the ground floor. 
Then, she heard them going upstairs. She got scared and 
hid under the table. Four men came into her room, but she 
couldn't hear what they were saying. After a while, they left.

She came out from hiding and lit the candle again. 
She looked in the mirror and saw something scary. She 
realized she had died a few days ago and was now a ghost 
stuck in her own house. The men were people who hunt ghosts.
